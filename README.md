# AllFields

AllFields is a platform for soccer enthusiasts! Users can look up field conditions, create accounts, and share their own reviews, like Yelp and AllTrails. The goal is to help soccer players find the best fields to play on before they head out to the field. 


## Demo

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React, HTML, JS, CSS, Styled Components

**Server:** Firebase (Authentication, Storage, Realtime Database)

This project was made with Firebase. It's a small scale passion project where the main priorities are getting features up and running. Saving user data (posts) seem suitable for the JSON-like data schema as well, thus making Firebase a good option.
