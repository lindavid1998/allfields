**Client:** React, React Router, HTML, JS, CSS, Styled Components

**Server:** Firebase (Authentication, Storage, Realtime Database)

This project was made with Firebase. It's a small scale passion project where the main priority is learning to build and ship out new features. Saving user data (posts) and field data (name, address, etc.) seemed suitable for the JSON-like data schema as well, thus making Firebase a good option.
